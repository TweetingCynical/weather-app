## About the Project

### Deployment / Code Repository

[Live deployment](https://tweetingcynical.github.io/weather-app/)

[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/weather-app)

### Screenshot

Working version of site should look like this at standard screen size:
![Site Screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

### Scope and Purpose

Build an interactive Weather Forecase App which utilises openweathermap api, and presents data for the current moment, and also the 5 days ahead.

### Usage

This site and its codeset are for educational purposes only.

### Installation

No installation required. Users can search for a city, or press the button of a city they have previously searched for.

<!-- Pseudocode and overview of build -->

## Pseudocode

Steps to achieving the working Weather Forecase App:

- Check localStorage for stored history;
  - If there is history, create the buttons for each city using a for loop;
- Add a searched city to local storage history when a city is searched;
  - Create a new button when that city is searched;
- Create api search term and change from city to co-ordinates;
- Use api data to get weather information for current weather:
  - TODAY SECTION:
  - Create a title, icon, temp, wind and humidity element;
  - Fill those elements with data from api;
  - Append to TODAY section;
  - FORECAST SECTION:
  - Filter out records in api data that are not necessary;
  - For loop to create a card for each of the next 5 days;
  - Create a title, icon, temp, wind and humidity element;
  - Fill those elements with data from api;
  - Append to FORECAST section;
- Add event listeners to buttons from search history, so that when they are clicked, they call the same function as the search button

## Overview of Build

Some of the key JavaScript skills being utilised:

- Use of local storage to store previously searched cities:

  ```javascript
  function checkHistory() {
    let searched = localStorage.getItem("searched");

    if (searched) {
      userHistory = JSON.parse(searched);
    }
    createButtons();
  }
  ```

- Use of jQuery's ajax to get api data for use in the app:

  ```javascript
  function getCoordinates(city) {
    let queryCoordinatesURL = `${initAPIURL}/geo/1.0/direct?q=${city}&limit=5&appid=${myKey}`;

    $.ajax({
      url: queryCoordinatesURL,
      method: "GET",
    }).then(function (data) {
      if (!data[0]) {
        alert("This city was not found. Please try again.");
      } else {
        appendHistory(city);
        getWeather(data[0]);
      }
    });
  }
  ```

- Use of moment.js to handle date formatting:

  ```javascript
  const displayDateC = moment().format("ddd, Do MMM YYYY"); // Sun, 5th Feb 2023
  const displayDateF = moment(
    dailyForecast[i].dt_txt,
    "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"
  ).format("ddd"); // Mon
  ```

- Use of stored api information to create image icons:

  ```javascript
  const icon = `${initAPIURL}/img/w/${weatherInfo.weather[0].icon}.png`;
  ```

- Use of .filter() and .includes() to remove all api data that relates to times we do not wish to display in the site:

  ```javascript
  let dailyForecast = weatherInfo.filter(function (info) {
    return info.dt_txt.includes("12:00:00");
  });
  ```

- Use of .hasClass to check information about the button being clicked, and use it to decide what action to take:

  ```javascript
  function historyClick(event) {
    if (!$(event.target).hasClass("btn-main")) {
      return;
    }
    let city = $(event.target).attr("id");
    getCoordinates(city);
    input.val("");
  }
  ```

### Suggested future changes

- Add a map section so that user can visually see that they have chosen the correct city;
- Add an option to select a different city than the first in the api list;
- âœ… ~~Add button to clear history from localStorage;~~
- Adjust .filter() .includes() to take into account the timezone of the city searched for;
